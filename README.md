# Program = Proof
My solutions to the excellent class on type theory and formal verification (INF551) taught by Samuel Mimram at the Ecole Polytechnique in 2018:
[INF551 â€“ Computational logic: from Artificial intelligence to Zero bugs](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Samuel.Mimram/teaching/INF551/)

The class is now available as a book, called [Program = Proof](https://www.amazon.com/PROGRAM-PROOF-Samuel-Mimram/dp/B08C97TD9G). I highly recommend it.

Code in either OCaml or Agda.
